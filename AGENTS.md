# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.

# KBase - AI Agent Guide

Welcome to the KBase development workspace. This guide provides AI agents with essential information and links to navigate the codebase and development workflows.

## Project Overview

**KBase** is a web-based note-taking application inspired by Obsidian and Joplin, designed to be lightweight with minimal moving parts and markdown-first with dual editor support.

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vue 3 with TypeScript, Pinia for state management
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11+)
- **Editor**: Monaco Editor (VS Code experience)
- **Storage**: Markdown files on filesystem
- **Authentication**: JWT-based
- **Build Tools**: Vite (frontend), uv (backend)
- **Testing**: Playwright (e2e), Vitest (unit), pytest (backend)

## Development Workflows

KBase uses structured workflows for different types of changes. Choose the appropriate workflow based on your task:

### When to Use Which Workflow

| Task Type | Workflow | Reference |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Bug Fix** (restore intended behavior) | Direct TDD fix | `.cursor/rules/20-tdd-workflow.md` |
| **New Feature** | OpenSpec proposal â†’ Implementation | `openspec/AGENTS.md` |
| **Breaking Change** | OpenSpec proposal | `openspec/AGENTS.md` |
| **Architecture Change** | OpenSpec proposal | `openspec/AGENTS.md` |
| **Documentation Update** | Direct update | `.cursor/rules/10-docs-major-changes.md` |
| **Typo/Formatting** | Direct fix | No special workflow |

---

## OpenSpec Workflow (Features & Changes)

> **IMPORTANT**: OpenSpec is the authoritative source for spec-driven development.  
> See `openspec/AGENTS.md` for complete instructions. This section is a brief overview only.

For **new features**, **breaking changes**, or **architectural modifications**, use the OpenSpec spec-driven development workflow.

### When to use OpenSpec

**Always use OpenSpec for**:
- New features or capabilities
- Breaking changes (API, schema, behavior)
- Architecture changes
- Major performance optimizations
- Security pattern updates

**Never use OpenSpec for**:
- Bug fixes (restore intended behavior)
- Typos, formatting, comments
- Dependency updates (non-breaking)
- Configuration changes
- Tests for existing behavior

> Refer to the decision tree in `openspec/AGENTS.md` for detailed guidance.

### Quick Reference

- **Complete workflow**: See `openspec/AGENTS.md`
- **Project conventions**: See `openspec/project.md`
- **Current specs**: `openspec/specs/` (what IS built)
- **Proposals**: `openspec/changes/` (what SHOULD change)

### Essential Commands

```bash
openspec list                  # Show active proposals
openspec list --specs          # Show all capabilities
openspec show <item>           # Display details
openspec validate <item>       # Validate changes
openspec archive <change-id>   # Mark proposal complete
```

## TDD Workflow (Bug Fixes & Small Changes)

For **bug fixes** and **small incremental changes**, follow the Test-Driven Development workflow.

### Key Files
- **Workflow**: `.cursor/rules/20-tdd-workflow.md` - Core TDD process
- **TypeScript Guide**: `.cursor/rules/21-tdd-typescript-react.md` - Frontend TDD
- **Python Guide**: `.cursor/rules/22-tdd-python-fastapi.md` - Backend TDD

### TDD Process
1. **Red**: Write failing test
2. **Green**: Implement minimal fix
3. **Refactor**: Clean up while keeping tests green

See `.cursor/rules/README.md` for the complete workflow overview.

## Critical Development Rules

### Documentation Requirements

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL**: All code changes MUST be accompanied by documentation updates. This is non-negotiable.

See `.cursorrules` for the complete documentation checklist. Key points:
- Update `docs/architecture-design.md` for architecture changes
- Update `docs/api-endpoints.md` for API changes
- Update `README.md` for setup/usage changes
- Create feature docs in `docs/templates/` for new major features

Reference: `.cursorrules` (lines 1-217), `.cursor/rules/10-docs-major-changes.md`

### Security Requirements

Security is paramount. Always validate:
- Path traversal protection (use `os.path.abspath()` and `os.path.commonpath()`)
- Input validation (Pydantic models, sanitization)
- JWT authentication on protected endpoints
- File type validation

Reference: `.cursorrules` (lines 64-82)

### Test Coverage

- Maintain **80%+ coverage**
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Include error conditions and edge cases
- Test security features explicitly

Reference: `.cursorrules` (lines 85-98)

### Code Quality

**Python Backend**:
- PEP 8 style guidelines
- Type hints required
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Functions max 50 lines

**Frontend (TypeScript/Vue)**:
- TypeScript strict mode
- Composition API
- Pinia for state management
- Component-focused architecture

Reference: `.cursorrules` (lines 39-62)

## Quick Reference

### Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm run install:all

# Start both frontend and backend
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm run test              # All tests
npm run test:backend      # Backend only
npm run test:frontend     # Frontend only
```

### Documentation Links

### Common Tasks

**Adding a new API endpoint**:
1. Check `openspec/specs/` for existing spec
2. Create OpenSpec proposal if no spec exists
3. Follow TDD workflow: write test â†’ implement â†’ refactor
4. Update `docs/api-endpoints.md`
5. Update `docs/architecture-design.md`

**Adding a new UI feature**:
1. Check `openspec/specs/` for existing spec
2. Create OpenSpec proposal if no spec exists
3. Follow TDD workflow
4. Update relevant documentation

**Fixing a bug**:
1. Identify root cause
2. Write failing test (TDD Red phase)
3. Fix implementation (TDD Green phase)
4. Refactor if needed (TDD Refactor phase)
5. Update docs if behavior changed

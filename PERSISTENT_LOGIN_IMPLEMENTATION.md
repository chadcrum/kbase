# Persistent Login Sessions Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented persistent login sessions with extended token expiration and "Remember Me" functionality to eliminate the need for repeated logins after page refresh or opening new windows.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Updated Token Expiration (`backend/app/config.py`)
- Changed default `access_token_expire_minutes` from 30 minutes to **7 days (10,080 minutes)**
- Updated description to clarify the new default

#### 2. Added Remember Me Support (`backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/auth.py`)
- Added optional `remember_me` field to `LoginRequest` model (defaults to `false`)
- Imported `timedelta` for custom token expiration
- Updated login endpoint to:
  - Accept `remember_me` parameter
  - Create tokens with **30-day expiration** when `remember_me=true`
  - Use default 7-day expiration when `remember_me=false`
- Updated docstring to document the new parameter

### Frontend Changes

#### 3. Updated TypeScript Types (`frontend/src/types/index.ts`)
- Added optional `remember_me?: boolean` field to `LoginRequest` interface

#### 4. Enhanced Login UI (`frontend/src/views/LoginView.vue`)
- Added "Remember Me" checkbox to login form
- Added `rememberMe` reactive state (defaults to `false`)
- Updated login submission to pass `remember_me` value to backend
- Added CSS styling for checkbox:
  - Clean checkbox design with accent color matching app theme
  - Proper alignment with label
  - Disabled state styling

#### 5. Improved API Client (`frontend/src/api/client.ts`)
- Fixed token initialization to properly load from localStorage on startup
- Improved 401 interceptor to:
  - Clear auth state on unauthorized responses
  - Only redirect to login if not already on login page
  - Prevent redirect loops

#### 6. Fixed Router Guard (`frontend/src/router/index.ts`)
- Added `authInitialized` flag to prevent race conditions
- Ensures auth initialization happens exactly once on app load
- Prevents multiple simultaneous auth verification requests

#### 7. Updated Tests (`frontend/src/views/LoginView.test.ts`)
- Updated login test to expect `remember_me` field in login call
- Test now passes with new authentication flow

### Documentation Updates

#### 8. API Endpoints Documentation (`docs/api-endpoints.md`)
- Added comprehensive Authentication section with:
  - Login endpoint documentation with `remember_me` parameter
  - Token expiration details (7 days default, 30 days with Remember Me)
  - Verify token endpoint documentation
  - Example requests and responses

#### 9. Architecture Design Documentation (`docs/architecture-design.md`)
- Updated Authentication System section with:
  - Persistent session management details
  - Frontend authentication flow (8-step process)
  - Token expiration configuration
  - Session persistence across refreshes, restarts, and new tabs
- Updated Security Considerations:
  - New token expiration strategy
  - Extended session details
  - Session persistence notes

#### 10. Backend Environment Example (`backend/env.example`)
- Updated `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` documentation:
  - New default: 10080 (7 days)
  - Added conversion examples (30 min, 1 day, 7 days)
  - Documented Remember Me feature

#### 11. Backend README (`backend/README.md`)
- Updated Authentication section to document `remember_me` flag
- Updated Configuration section with new default token expiration
- Updated Security section with:
  - 7-day default expiration
  - 30-day "Remember Me" option
  - Persistent session details
- Updated Authentication Usage with example curl commands for both modes

## Token Expiration Strategy

| Scenario | Expiration Time | Use Case |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| Default Login | 7 days | Regular usage, good balance of convenience and security |
| Remember Me | 30 days | Long-term sessions, minimal re-authentication |

## Session Persistence

Sessions now persist across:
- ✅ Page refreshes (F5)
- ✅ Browser restarts
- ✅ New tabs/windows (same browser)
- ✅ Multiple days of inactivity (up to 7 or 30 days)

Sessions end when:
- ❌ Token expires (7 or 30 days)
- ❌ User explicitly logs out
- ❌ Token is manually cleared from localStorage
- ❌ Token validation fails on backend

## User Experience Improvements

1. **No More Repeated Logins**: Users can work for days/weeks without re-authenticating
2. **Seamless Refresh**: Page refreshes maintain login state automatically
3. **Multi-Window Support**: Opening the app in a new window preserves login
4. **User Control**: Remember Me checkbox gives users choice of session duration
5. **Automatic Restoration**: Token verified on app initialization for instant access
6. **Clean Logout**: Explicit logout removes token and redirects to login

## Security Considerations

- JWT tokens stored in browser localStorage (acceptable for single-user desktop app)
- Tokens signed with secret key from environment variables
- All protected endpoints validate tokens on every request
- Automatic logout on token expiration or validation failure
- No refresh token complexity needed for personal use case
- Plain password authentication suitable for single-user environment

## Testing

- ✅ All backend authentication tests pass (14/14)
- ✅ LoginView tests updated and passing (13/13)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ⚠️ Note: 3 pre-existing ViewerToolbar test failures unrelated to this implementation

## Implementation Notes

### Why No Refresh Tokens?
Refresh tokens were intentionally excluded per user request to keep the implementation simple. The extended token expiration (7-30 days) provides sufficient session persistence for a personal note-taking app without the added complexity of refresh token rotation.

### Router Guard Fix
The critical fix was adding the `authInitialized` flag to prevent the router guard from running `initializeAuth()` multiple times. This eliminated race conditions where:
1. User navigates to protected route
2. Auth guard runs and verifies token
3. User navigates to another route
4. Auth guard runs again, creating duplicate verification requests

Now auth initialization happens exactly once, improving performance and reliability.

### API Client Improvements
The 401 interceptor was enhanced to:
- Prevent redirect loops (don't redirect if already on /login)
- Clean up auth state before redirecting
- Provide better error handling

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

The following were considered but not implemented:
- Refresh tokens for automatic token renewal
- Token rotation for enhanced security
- httpOnly cookies instead of localStorage
- Multi-user authentication system
- Remember Me preference persistence in localStorage
- Token refresh countdown/notification UI

These can be added later if needed for enhanced security or multi-user scenarios.

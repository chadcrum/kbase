# Search Highlighting Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added visual highlighting of search terms within snippet content, making it easier to identify relevant matches at a glance. Search terms are highlighted with a yellow background and bold font.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Highlighting Utility Function (`frontend/src/utils/highlightSearch.ts`)
Created a robust utility function for highlighting search terms:

**Key Features:**
- **HTML Escaping**: Prevents XSS attacks by escaping all HTML characters before processing
- **Case-Insensitive Matching**: Finds matches regardless of case
- **Multiple Term Support**: Handles space-separated search phrases
- **Regex Special Character Handling**: Properly escapes regex characters in search terms
- **Partial Matching**: Highlights search terms even when they're part of larger words
- **Phrase Prioritization**: Processes longer phrases first to minimize nested highlights

**Functions:**
- `highlightSearchTerms(text, searchQuery)`: Main function that wraps matches in `<mark>` tags
- `escapeHtml(text)`: Sanitizes HTML to prevent XSS
- `escapeRegex(text)`: Escapes regex special characters

#### 2. Updated OmniSearch Component (`frontend/src/components/common/OmniSearch.vue`)

**Template Changes:**
- Changed from text interpolation `{{ snippet.content }}` to `v-html` directive
- Added `getHighlightedContent()` method call for each snippet

**Script Changes:**
- Imported `highlightSearchTerms` utility
- Added `getHighlightedContent()` function that applies highlighting

**Style Changes:**
- Added styling for `<mark>` tags within snippet content:
  - Background: `#fef08a` (yellow)
  - Text color: `#713f12` (dark brown)
  - Font weight: 600 (semi-bold)
  - Padding: `0.1rem 0.2rem`
  - Border radius: `2px`
- Used `:deep()` selector for scoped style penetration into v-html content

#### 3. Comprehensive Test Suite (`frontend/src/utils/highlightSearch.test.ts`)
Created 16 tests covering all aspects of highlighting:

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Single term highlighting
- ✅ Multiple occurrence highlighting
- ✅ Multiple term highlighting
- ✅ Case-insensitive matching
- ✅ Case preservation in highlights
- ✅ HTML escaping for XSS protection
- ✅ Empty query/text handling
- ✅ Special regex character handling
- ✅ Multiple spaces in query
- ✅ Phrase prioritization
- ✅ Partial word matching
- ✅ Leading/trailing space handling
- ✅ Special HTML characters in text
- ✅ Nested highlight prevention
- ✅ Unicode character support

**All 16 tests passing ✅**

### Documentation Updates

#### 4. Architecture Design (`docs/architecture-design.md`)
- Added "Search Highlighting" to Omni Search features
- Updated to reflect XSS protection
- Moved highlighting from "Future Features" to implemented features
- Updated future enhancements to focus on remaining features

## Technical Details

### Security Considerations
The implementation prioritizes security:
1. **HTML Escaping**: All content is escaped before highlighting to prevent XSS attacks
2. **Safe v-html Usage**: Only user-controlled search terms are highlighted, not arbitrary HTML
3. **Regex Injection Prevention**: Search terms are escaped before creating regex patterns

### Highlighting Algorithm
```
1. Escape HTML special characters in the snippet text
2. Split search query into individual phrases
3. Sort phrases by length (longest first)
4. For each phrase:
   - Escape regex special characters
   - Create case-insensitive regex pattern
   - Replace matches with <mark> tags
5. Return highlighted HTML string
```

### Visual Design
- **Color Scheme**: Yellow (`#fef08a`) background with dark brown (`#713f12`) text
- **Typography**: Bold (600) font weight for emphasis
- **Spacing**: Small padding around highlights for readability
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrated with existing snippet styling

## Performance Impact
- **Minimal**: Client-side highlighting is fast and doesn't impact search performance
- **Efficient Regex**: Uses optimized regex patterns for matching
- **No Server Load**: All highlighting done in the browser

## User Experience Improvements
1. **Visual Clarity**: Users can immediately see which terms matched
2. **Multi-term Support**: All search phrases are highlighted distinctly
3. **Context**: Highlights help users determine relevance before opening files
4. **Consistency**: Same highlighting style throughout the interface

## Future Enhancements
- Click on highlighted term to jump to that line in the editor
- Different colors for different search terms in multi-phrase searches
- Highlight preview in file name when filename matches
- Customizable highlight colors in user preferences

## Testing
- **Unit Tests**: 16 comprehensive tests (100% passing)
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript type checking passes
- **XSS Testing**: Verified HTML escaping prevents script injection
- **Edge Cases**: Tested Unicode, special characters, and nested highlights

## Comparison: Before vs After

**Before:**
```
15  This is a test line with some content
42  Another test line that matches
```

**After:**
```
15  This is a [test] line with some content
42  Another [test] line that matches
```
*(Where [test] is highlighted in yellow with bold font)*

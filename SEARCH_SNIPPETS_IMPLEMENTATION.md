# Search Snippets Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added content snippets with line numbers to the omni-search feature, enhancing search results by showing up to 3 matching lines per file.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. API Models (`backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/notes.py`)
- Added `Snippet` model with `line_number` (int) and `content` (str)
- Updated `SearchResult` model to include `snippets: List[Snippet]` field

#### 2. Search Implementation (`backend/app/services/file_service.py`)
- **Enhanced `search_notes()` method:**
  - Now returns snippets alongside search results
  - Modified to work with dict mapping file paths to snippets
  
- **Refactored `_search_with_ripgrep()` method:**
  - Two-pass search approach:
    1. First pass: Find all files matching all search phrases
    2. Second pass: Extract snippets with line numbers using `rg -n --max-count 3`
  - Returns `Dict[Path, List[Dict]]` mapping file paths to snippet lists
  - Limits to first 3 matches per file
  - Combines all search phrases with OR regex for efficient snippet extraction
  
- **Added fallback methods:**
  - `_fallback_search_files()`: File-only search when ripgrep unavailable
  - `_fallback_search_with_snippets()`: Python-based snippet extraction fallback

### Frontend Changes

#### 3. TypeScript Types (`frontend/src/types/index.ts`)
- Added `Snippet` interface with `line_number` and `content` fields
- Updated `SearchResult` interface to include `snippets: Snippet[]`

#### 4. UI Component (`frontend/src/components/common/OmniSearch.vue`)
- **Template updates:**
  - Added snippets display section below file path
  - Each snippet shows line number and content
  - Conditional rendering when snippets are available
  
- **Styling:**
  - `.result-snippets`: Flex column layout with gap
  - `.snippet-line`: Monospace font with light background
  - `.snippet-line-number`: Right-aligned, gray color, fixed width
  - `.snippet-content`: Truncated with ellipsis for long lines
  - Subtle border-left accent for visual distinction

### Documentation Updates

#### 5. Architecture Design (`docs/architecture-design.md`)
- Updated API endpoint list with search endpoint details
- Added SearchService description with snippet capabilities
- Added OmniSearch component to common components list
- Added comprehensive "Omni Search" section to Key Features
- Moved search from "Future Features" to implemented features

#### 6. API Endpoints (`docs/api-endpoints.md`)
- Added detailed "Search Notes" endpoint documentation
- Included request/response examples with snippets
- Added SearchResponse, SearchResult, and Snippet to Common Response Models
- Documented query parameters and behavior

### Testing

#### 7. New Test Suite (`backend/tests/test_search.py`)
Created comprehensive test coverage:
- Basic search functionality
- Snippet structure validation
- 3-snippet limit enforcement
- Empty query handling
- Multi-phrase search
- Case-insensitivity verification
- Result limit parameter
- Authentication requirement

**Test Results:** All 65 backend tests passing (9 new search tests + 56 existing tests)

## Technical Details

### Search Algorithm
1. Split query into space-separated phrases
2. Find files matching ALL phrases (content or filename)
3. Use ripgrep with `-n --max-count 3` to get first 3 matches per file
4. Parse output format: `filename:line_number:content`
5. Return files with snippets (empty array for filename-only matches)

### Performance Optimizations
- Uses ripgrep for speed (50-100x faster than pure Python)
- Limits to 3 snippets per file to reduce payload size
- Results limited to 50 files by default (configurable 1-100)
- Efficient two-pass approach minimizes ripgrep invocations

### UI/UX Enhancements
- Monospace font for code-like appearance
- Line numbers right-aligned and visually distinct
- Subtle background colors for readability
- Ellipsis for long lines to prevent overflow
- Maintains existing search modal design

## Future Enhancements
- Syntax highlighting within snippets
- Context lines around matches
- Jump to line number when clicking snippet
- Relevance scoring for snippet ordering
- Search term highlighting in snippet content

# Deep Nested Note

This note is deeply nested to test complex folder structures.

## Deep Nesting Test

Path: `folder2/deep/nested.md`

This tests:
- Deep folder expansion
- Long path handling
- Nested navigation

### Complex Structure

```
folder2/
└── deep/
    └── nested.md
```

This demonstrates how the file tree handles:
- Multiple levels of nesting
- Long folder names
- Deep path navigation
